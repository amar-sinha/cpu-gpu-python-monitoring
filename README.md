# Python Monitoring Program for CPU/GPU Water Cooling Unit

### <u>Goal</u>
To develop a program that collects live data from temperature and water flow rate sensors installed in a central processing unit (CPU) / graphics processing unit (GPU) water cooling system. The program will output the collected data in a text file and in graph format that is live updated as long as the program is running.

### <u>Implementation</u>
